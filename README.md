# Introduction

The following types of picture frames and frame accessories are implemented here, each represented by one or more OpenSCAD source files. If you want any of them, I recommend you put all the project files into a single directory and use the OpenSCAD client to open the ones you're interested in.

This project is implemented in the open-source [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) CAD modeling scripting language. To make use of these scripts install the free OpenSCAD client on your PC, fire it up, and open a .SCAD file.

It has an optional recess or cutout in the back in a variety of shapes, to make it easy to center a smaller work in a "mat" or to create a cup to contain a deeper work. These photos show one that has a cutout to display both sides of a coin. |
