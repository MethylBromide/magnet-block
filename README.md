# Introduction

The following types of picture frames and frame accessories are implemented here, each represented by one or more OpenSCAD source files. If you want any of them, I recommend you put all the project files into a single directory and use the OpenSCAD client to open the ones you're interested in.

This project is implemented in the open-source [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) CAD modeling scripting language. To make use of these scripts install the free OpenSCAD client on your PC, fire it up, and open a .SCAD file.

It has an optional recess or cutout in the back in a variety of shapes, to make it easy to center a smaller work in a "mat" or to create a cup to contain a deeper work. These photos show one that has a cutout to display both sides of a coin. |



## Lightweight Frame with Recess

Similar in concept to the Magnet Block model, but for pre-existing artwork that doesn't have "wrap around" flaps on it -- a simple rectangular picture or other pre-existing object. This is designed to use less material while acommodating existing art of various sizes and shapes.

The model consists of two parts that snap together -- a "frame" that goes around the outside, and a "block" that fits into a rectangular hole in the back of the frame and clicks into place. The block may have a hole punched through it so the artwork can be displayed behind, or a recess sized to fit the artwork. The above image shows a frame with a shallow rectangular recess, but other shapes are possible, by providing an SVG file that defines the shape of opening you want.

### Printing Considerations

The frame component should print with no trouble in its default configuration generated by this script. The block component, if it has a recess, will need supports because there's no orientation that doesn't have overhangs, and should generally print face-up to get a nicer-looking surface in the bottom of the recess. The script will generate the STL file in that orientation in that case.
